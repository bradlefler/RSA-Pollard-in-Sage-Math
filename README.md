# RSA-Pollard-in-Sage-Math

#### This Algorithm uses Pollard P-1 Factorization to break RSA Encryption in Sage Math. Of course, this would never work in a real RSA Cryptosystem, the numbers are too large to factor efficiently. In this example, the numbers are small enough to factor. This algorithm was used to solve a homework problem. The problem reads:

#### Suppose Kevin's RSA Public Key is (n,e) where:
#### n = 220128835277449925107431266612427384407262202305202431607111
#### e = 128024737561552881724963970278037549376957617171184078187307

#### 1. Implement the Pollar P-1 Method in Sage Math. Use your program to factor n.

#### 2. Suppose you intercept the following message intended for Kevin:
#### 16992147835794015657284498152956801795162802301549954179440
#### Decrypt the message to find the plaintext. Give your output as an integer.

#### 3. You speculate the message you intercepted may have been a text message. Decode the message in the standard way to reveal the original text.
